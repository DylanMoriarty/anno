title: "Magic Man"
descrip: "<p>Went on a venture today out to Alexandria, which has a boardwalk area with dozens of street performers. There were five caricature artists doodling away, numerous musicians, and this old guy doing magic. When I first walked by he didn't have an audience and was actually messing up the rings trick- as I was passing they came undone in a wrong way that showed that the rings indeed split apart. <p>When I walked by again some thirty minutes later he had an audience, and was performing a fun trick which I couldn't tell you how he did. I'm sure there's a moral here somewhere."
