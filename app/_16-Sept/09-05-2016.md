descrip: "Inspired by some <a href='http://torpedofactory.org/profile/wei_l/#mpf-popup@http://torpedofactory.org/wp-content/uploads/importedmedia/torpfac-2059.jpg|2059|52b7100ce0d29'>Japanese watercolor art</a> I saw by Liang Wei at the Torpedo Factory yesterday, I spent a little bit of time today trying to replicate hand drawn lines in Mapbox for country borders. <p>Results seen here are alright, but the means of making it doesn't scale well for smooth zooms. Definitely a 'Work In Progress' kinda thing."
