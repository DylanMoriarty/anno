I hope this isn't cheating too much.

But hey! Chance is good this will let me write these up a hair quicker. There's a slight interactive element as well- whenever you see one of these <span class="tooltip">little info boxes<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Hopefully this will help cut down the endless amount of ( ) I typically use when I write these.</span></span> , you can hover over it to get a footnote on the subject. Also, I can add tunes right here in the letter itself! Wow!

Anyway, a lot's happened! Here's a highlight reel:

<b>January</b>

Started up by finishing <a href="https://www.workelections.com/#/">Work Elections</a>, a site where you can look up how to work at your county's polling station. ..but they still haven't added more states despite this launching 5 months ago.

I also met a lovely gal named <span class="tooltip">Taylor<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa"></i><span class="tooltiptext"><img src = "/assets/graphics/ltrs/hp1/Taylor.jpg" /></span></span> She's dope, and go figure, also from Wisconsin.

<b>February</b>

I finally managed to make it out to the National Portrait Gallery! It turns out they do free concerts there every month, so I got to enjoy some brews and tunes in the gallery on the 3rd floor. About 3 beers in and during a crescendo I literally shorted out for a few minutes unable to process my surroundings. In a good way.

Also caught a few more bands in the area and am just floored by how immobile the crowds out here are. Ya'll paid $25 to come see a pop punk band (Ra-Ra Riot in this case) and they just stand there like farm yard animals staring into highway traffic. Waggling all the fists here.

At Devseed we launched <a href="http://www.missingmaps.org/">MissingMaps</a> this month too! 

<b>March</b>

Maria, an old friend & former room-mate from Madison decided to come visit me out here for her Summer Break. I was definitely not the best guide (particularly for someone trying to experience DC <span class="tooltip">on a budget<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa"></i><span class="tooltiptext">I'm pretty sure this is impossible. We tried to find a place that served pasta under $10. We failed.</span></span> ), but she seemed to have a good time. We hit up the National Geographic museum, Capitol Tour, & the Library of Congress. Which holy shit is amazing! They even had not one but two displays up for Carotgraphic history.

The best night might have been a venture we made out to Adams Morgan. Without any real plans, we bar crawled down 18th for happy hour and then go invited to a feminist art gallery showing at the fucking Ritz Carleton. We drunkingly meandered over to the hotel where we immediately felt out of place. A nice door man walked us through the main lobby and to the (free) event. We rushed past folks in tuxedo's and nice gowns settled next to huge fireplaces drinking expensive colorful drinks from the hotel bar. 

The folks at the showing were a little more casual but we spent a good while trying to figure out if they were even selling beer. <b>Everyone</b> was drinking wine. We stuck around pretty late there, so Maria got hit on by a small menagerie of dudes. Two at the same time even. We left much as we arrived- drunk, delighted, & out into a place we didn't belong (Georgetown. Yuck).

<b>April</b>

Caught Har Mar Superstar live! He's like a weird mixture of a great Soul Singer, Ron Jeremy, and Jon Lovitz. Concert was ~amazin~, but still hardly anyone was dancing.

Also in the span of two days my main laptop & phone both died. Insurance kicked in and everything was alright, but that was a pretty terrifying couple days. It's kinda nice to be free from devices for a lil' while tho.

<b>May</b>

Saw FiveThirtyEight live. I'm not sure if you're familiar with em', but they're THE data journalism news source out there. Afterwards I managed to grab Nate Silver's autograph and died with joy inside.

Along the same lines, I also saw Comedy Bang Bang live- which had both Lauren Lampkus & Paul F. Tompkins! They also stuck around til after the show, so I was able to personally thank PFT for the Dead Authors Podcast. He seemed exhausted from shaking 100 or so folks hands prior to mine, but was still nice enough about it.

And most recently, I saw a Nationals game! Lost ~$7 gambling on the game. That stadium is great. Beer prices make me weep inside.


..Maybe I should stick to post cards.
